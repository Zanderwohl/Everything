# Everything

Imagine managing your entire life from a single .txt file, with a CLI to help. Wouldn't that be a bad idea? That's why I'm trying it.

## The File

The file is a simple text file called 'everything.txt' and I've hard-coded the path in the application for now. Since this is a home-brewed app I don't expect (and in fact, would discourage) anyone else to use. 

### But why a .txt?

1. To keep it human-readable, so I can simply edit the file directly.
2.	I didn't even expect to write a program for i. This was just a text TODO list organized by day, until I wanted to write a script to crawl the file to find TODO items per-day and add them to the top of the file. It just got out of hand.
3. I like writing parsers.

## File Formatting

I'll add the anatomy of an everything file, plus examples, later.
